2. Merge datasets to create a workable dataframe
3. Calculate the total rides, drivers, and the amount of fares for each city type
4. Calculate the average fare per ride for each city type
5. Calculate the average fare per driver for each city type
6. Create a Pyber Summary Dataframe
7. Plot line chart analysis from the created Pyber Dataframe to show the differences in fares per city
